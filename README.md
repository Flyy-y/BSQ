BSQ
==
The biggest project of 42 School. 

Why ?
--
It was firstly made in C, then I choosed to learn C++, with the same project. Now, I'm working to use CUDA to make it faster on Nvidia hardware !

How to build ?
--
The actual build system is by using a simple Makefile. When CUDA is relased, the project is gonna use CMake. 

Dependencies :
 - CUDA Compiler
 - C++ Compiler
 
Easy complete build :
 ```
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ..
 make
 ```
